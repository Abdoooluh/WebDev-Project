                            could make such a meaningful impact. Witnessing the project, which was initially an academic endeavor,
                            turn into a lifesaver is truly gratifying. It's a testament to the potential of technology and the skills
                            our students acquire. I'm proud to have guided a team that created something so impactful. Kudos to the team!"
